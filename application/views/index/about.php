                <p>One of the most painful things in life is losing someone we love, but in these dark days during the Coronavirus crisis, losing someone became even more painful.</p>
                <p>One of the unfortunate consequences of the COIVID-19 pandemic (Coronavirus) is that almost all of its victims have been mourned without funerals nor the proper goodbye they truly deserve.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is our mission at Corona Tribute, To give those who have lost someone special during the crisis the opportunity to preserve their loved one's memory and say goodbye, tell stories and share memories and pictures, pay homage to their memory by creating a free online memorial.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This service is 100% non-profit, everything here is totally free, no hidden fees. was created only to honor all the victim of the pandemic and to give their families and friends the chance to grieve and say goodbye and preserve their memories, and also, for everyone around the world to know them by their names and by their stories and pictures not by their number in the statistics.</p>
